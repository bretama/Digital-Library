# this file should be placed in the same directory as your library

# points to the GSDLHOME directory
# This must be set, and must point to the top level Greenstone directory
# (usually gsdl or Greenstone)
gsdlhome    **GSDLHOME**

# this is the http address of GSDLHOME
# if your webserver's DocumentRoot is set to $GSDLHOME
# then httpprefix can be commented out
httpprefix  /greenstone

# this is the http address of the Greenstone web directory (which contains
# images, style etc)
# if your web directory is a top level folder inside $GSDLHOME, then this
# can remain commented out, and will default to httpprefix/web
#httpweb     /greenstone/web

# this should contain the http address of the library.cgi script. This 
# is not needed if the http server sets the environment variable 
# SCRIPT_NAME
# Generally this is not needed with Apache
#gwcgi       /greenstone/cgi-bin/library.cgi

# maxrequests is the most requests a fastcgi process
# will serve before it exits. This can be set to a
# low figure (like 1) while debugging and then set
# to a high figure (like 10000) when everything is
# working well.
# Only applies if you are using fastcgi
maxrequests 10000

# Remote Greenstone Options (for server side)

# If Perl is not already on your PATH, set the following to the 
# full path of the perl bin directory (Perl's parent folder) 
# and it will be prepended to the PATH.
#perlpath /usr/bin

# Options for FLI

# If using Greenstone's GLIServer to run the Fedora Librarian
# Interface (FLI), then you need to set fedora version and fedora home
# variables, either below, or as environment variables. 
# FEDORA_VERSION is the major version number of Fedora and  
# FEDORA_HOME is the full path to your Fedora installation.
# Setting fedorahome and fedoraversion here will over-ride the
# FEDORA_HOME and FEDORA_VERSION environment variables.
#fedorahome /full/path/to/fedora
#fedoraversion 3

# If using Greenstone's GLIServer to run the Fedora Librarian
# Interface (FLI), then you need to set the full path to Java either as below 
# or as the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
# Setting javahome here will over-ride the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
#javahome /full/path/to/j2sdk1.4-or-higher

# Options for Open Office (used in converting Office documents)

# If using Open Office on Windows, then you can optionally customise the 
# following properties (defaults are as shown). E.g. if Open Office is not 
# located in C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 3\program, then you'll want 
# to provide its new path by specifying soffice_home.
#soffice_home "C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 3\program"
#soffice_host 127.0.0.1
#soffice_port 8200
#jodconverter_port 8100
