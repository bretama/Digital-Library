<p>Greenstone can export one or more collections to a self-installing CD/DVD for Windows. </p>

<p>To export a collection, open the "File" menu and choose "Write CD/DVD Image". A list of Greenstone collections appears; click on any one to see its description. Tick the check boxes of the collections to export. You can enter the CD/DVD's name in the "CD/DVD name" box: this is what will appear in the Start menu when the CD/DVD has been installed. You can choose whether the resulting CD-ROM or DVD runs directly from the disk drive, or installs some files onto the computer. Then click "Write CD/DVD image". The process involves copying many files and may take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Upon completion, Greenstone will show the name of a folder containing the exported collections. Use a CD/DVD writer to copy its contents to a blank CD/DVD.</p>
