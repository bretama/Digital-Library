<p>This section introduces you to the design view and explains how to navigate between the various views within this pane.</p>

<p>With the Librarian Interface, you can configure how the documents are processed, and how the collection is accessed by the user.  The configuration options are divided into different sections, each associated with a particular stage of collection customization.</p>

<p>On the left is a list of different views, and on the right are the controls associated with the current one.  To change to a different view, click its name in the list.</p>

<p>To understand the stages and terms involved in designing a collection, first read Chapters 1 and 2 of the Greenstone Developer's Guide.</p>
