<p>This section explains how to review and alter the general settings associated with your collection.  First, under the "Format" tab, click "General".</p>

<p>Here some collection wide metadata can be set or modified, including the title and description entered when starting a new collection.</p>

<p>First are the contact email addresses of the collection's creator and maintainer. The following field allows you to change the collection title. The folder that the collection is stored in is shown next, but this cannot be altered. Then comes the icon to show at the top left of the collection's "About" page (in the form of a URL), followed by the icon used in the Greenstone library page to link to the collection. Next is a checkbox that controls whether the collection should be publicly accessible. Finally comes the "Collection Description" text area as described in <a href="creatingacollection.htm">Creating a New Collection</a>.</p>
