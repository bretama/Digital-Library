<p>Save your work regularly by opening the "File" menu and choosing "Save". Saving a collection is not the same as making it ready for use in Greenstone (see <a href="producingthecollection.htm">Producing Your Collection</a>).</p>

<p>The Librarian Interface protects your work by saving it whenever you exit the program or load another collection.</p>

<p>Collections are saved to a folder within your Greenstone installation's "collect" folder, named with a short version of the collection name. Documents are saved to the "import" sub-folder, and metadata is saved to "metadata.xml" files within this folder. Configuration information is saved to the "collect.cfg" file within the "etc" sub-folder. Some information is also saved in a file named for the collection and with file extension ".col".</p>
