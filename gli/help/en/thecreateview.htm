<p>The Create view is used to create the collection by running Greenstone collection-building scripts on the information you have provided. Access the Create view by clicking the Create tab.</p>

<p>Clicking "Build Collection" initiates the collection building process.  The time this takes depends on the size of the collection and the number of indexes being created (for huge collections it can be hours). A progress bar indicates how much of the process has been completed. To cancel the process at any time, click "Cancel Build". The lower part of the panel shows some output from the build process. The upper part shows some options for controlling the build process.</p>

<p>Once the collection has successfully built, clicking "Preview Collection" will launch a web browser showing the home page of the collection.</p>
