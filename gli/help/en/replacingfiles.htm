<p>Files can be renamed by right-clicking them and selecting "Rename" from the list. Enter the new name at the prompt and click "OK".</p>

<p>Files can be replaced in the collection by right-clicking the file to replace and choosing "Replace". A file browser will open up: navigate to the new document and click "Open". The new document will replace the old one in the collection, and any metadata will be transferred to it. This is particularly useful for replacing dummy documents by their real ones.</p>

<p>Some file types are converted to HTML by third-party software during import, for example, Word, Excel, PDF etc. The HTML produced during import may not be very well formatted. These documents have a further right-click option: "Replace with HTML version". Selecting this option will replace the original file in the collection with the HTML version, which can then be edited.</p>
