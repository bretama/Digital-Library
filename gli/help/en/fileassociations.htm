<p>The Librarian Interface uses particular application programs to open particular file types. To alter file associations open the "File" menu and click "File Associations...".</p>

<p>To add an association, select the target file extension from the pull-down list, or type in a new extension (do not include the ".").  Next either type the command that launches the desired application in the appropriate field, or choose the application from the "Browse" dialog.  "%1" can be used in the launch command to insert the name of the file being opened.  Once these are filled out, "Add" is enabled and can be clicked to add the association.</p>

<p>To edit an association, select an existing file extension.  Any existing associated command is shown in the "launch command" field.  Edit it, and then click "Replace".</p>

<p>To remove an association, select an existing file extension and click "Remove".</p>

<p>File associations are stored in the Librarian Interface's main folder, in a file called "associations.xml".</p>
