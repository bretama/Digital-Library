<p>Use folders in the Collection file tree to group files together and make them easier to find.  Folders can be placed inside folders.  There is virtually no limit to how many folders you can have or how deeply they can be nested.</p>

<p>To create a new folder, click right in the Collection Pane (or click right on an existing folder in the Collection Tree to insert the new folder in it) and click on the New Folder option. The new folder appears within the selected one, or at the top level if none is selected. You are prompted for the folder's name (default "New Folder").</p>

<p>Folders can also be created by right-clicking in the Collection Tree, or over a folder, choosing "New Folder" and proceeding as above.</p>
