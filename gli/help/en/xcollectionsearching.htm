<p>Greenstone can search across several different collections as though they were one. This is done by specifying a list of other collections to be searched along with the current one.  Under the "Format" tab, click "Cross-Collection Search".</p>

<p>The Cross-Collection Search panel shows a checklist of available collections. The current collection is ticked and cannot be de-selected.  To add another collection to be searched in parallel, click it in the list (click again to remove it).  If only one collection is selected, there is no cross-collection searching.</p>

<p>If the individual collections do not have the same indexes (including sub-collection partitions and language partitions) as each other, cross-collection searching will not work properly. The user will only be able to search using indexes common to all collections.</p>

<p>For further details, see Chapter 1 of the Greenstone Developer's Guide.</p>
