I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go, <br>
I would hate my disappointment to show, <br>
there's nothing for me here so I will disappear <br>
if she turns up while I'm gone please let me know. <br>
<br>
I've had a drink or two and I don't care, <br>
there's no fun in what I do if she's not there, <br>
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long, <br>
I think I'll take a walk and look for her. <br>
<br>
Though tonight she's made me sad, <br>
I still love her, <br>
If I find her I'll be glad, <br>
I still love her. <br>
