I read the news today oh boy <br>
About a lucky man who made the grade <br>
And though the news was rather sad <br>
Well I just had to laugh <br>
I saw the photograph. <br>
<br>
He blew his mind out in a car <br>
He didn't notice that the lights had changed <br>
A crowd of people stood and stared <br>
They'd seen his face before <br>
Nobody was really sure <br>
If he was from the House of Lords. <br>
<br>
I saw a film today oh boy <br>
The English Army had just won the war <br>
A crowd of people turned away <br>
but I just had to look <br>
Having read the book. <br>
I'd love to turn you on <br>
<br>
Woke up, fell out of bed <br>
Dragged a comb across my had <br>
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, <br>
And looking up I noticed I was late. <br>
Found my coat and grabbed my hat <br>
Made the bus in seconds flat <br>
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, <br>
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream <br>
<br>
I read the news today oh boy <br>
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire <br>
And though the holes were rather small <br>
They had to count them all <br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. <br>
I'd love to turn you on </p>
