<i>(Harrison) Lead Vocal: Harrison</i><br>
<br>
<br>
I've got a word or two <br>
To say about the things that you do <br>
You're telling all those lies <br>
About the good things that we can have <br>
if we close our eyes <br>
<br>
Do what you want to do <br>
And go where you're going to <br>
Think for yourself <br>
'cause I won't be there with you <br>
<br>
I left you far behind <br>
The ruins of the life that you have in mind <br>
And though you still can't see <br>
I know your mind's made up <br>
You're gonna cause more misery <br>
<br>
Do what you want to do <br>
And go where you're going to <br>
Think for yourself <br>
'cause I won't be there with you <br>
<br>
Although your mind's opaque <br>
Try thinking more if just for your own sake <br>
The future still looks good <br>
And you've got time to rectify <br>
Al the things that you should <br>
<br>
Do what you want to do <br>
And go where you're going to <br>
Think for yourself <br>
'cause I won't be there with you <br>
<br>
Do what you want to do <br>
And go where you're going to <br>
Think for yourself <br>
'cause I won't be there with you <br>
Think for yourself <br>
'cause I won't be there with you </p>
