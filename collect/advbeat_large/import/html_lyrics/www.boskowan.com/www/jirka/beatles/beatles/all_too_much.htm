It's all too much, It's all too much <br>
<br>
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me <br>
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see <br>
<br>
It's all too much for me to take <br>
The love that's shining all around you <br>
Everywhere, it's what you make <br>
For us to take, it's all too much <br>
<br>
Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me <br>
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be <br>
<br>
It's all too much for me to take <br>
The love that's shining all around here <br>
All the world is birthday cake <br>
So take a piece but not too much <br>
<br>
Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free <br>
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for <br>
tea <br>
<br>
It's all too much for me to see <br>
A love that's shining all around here <br>
The more I am , the less I know <br>
And what I do is all too much <br>
<br>
It's al too much for me to take <br>
The love that's shining all around you <br>
Everywhere, it's what you make <br>
for us to take, it's all too much <br>
<br>
It's too much ....It's too much <br>
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue <br>
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue <br>
You're too much <br>
<br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much <br>
Too much, too much, too much </p>
