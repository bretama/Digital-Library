Well, she was just 17 <br>
You know what I mean <br>
And the way she looked, was way beyond compare <br>
So how could I dance with another (ooh) <br>
When I saw her standing there <br>
<br>
Well she looked at me, and I, I could see <br>
That before too long I'd fall in love with her <br>
So how could I dance with another (whooh) <br>
When I saw her standing there <br>
<br>
Well, my heart went &quot;boom&quot; <br>
When I crossed that room <br>
And I held her hand in mine <br>
<br>
Whoah, we danced through the night <br>
And we held each other tight <br>
And before too long I fell in love with her <br>
Now I'll never dance with antoher (whooh) <br>
Since I saw her standing there (Ahh!) <br>
