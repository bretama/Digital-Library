<br>
I tried to find out<br>
What love is all about<br>
And every day<br>
It sure lets out<br>
I see my baby<br>
I get week in my knees<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
My pappie told me<br>
There'd be times like these<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
<br>
We meet the gang<br>
And go to rocking Joes<br>
The cats are something<br>
On the heels and toes<br>
I grab my baby<br>
Tried to give her a squeeze<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
Well why must she be<br>
Such a doggone tease?<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
<br>
She's got a way<br>
That makes me act like a fool<br>
Spends my money<br>
Then she plays me cool<br>
I beg her for kisses<br>
On my bended knees<br>
Oh won't you give me<br>
Some loving, baby<br>
Please please please<br>
<br>
Though I keep trying hard<br>
To make her mine<br>
One day the wind will blow<br>
The sun will shine<br>
Till that time<br>
She puts my heart at ease<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
She locked my heart<br>
And threw away the keys<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees, yeah<br>
<br>
She's got a way<br>
That makes me act like a fool<br>
Spent my money<br>
Then she plays me cool<br>
I'm begging her for kisses<br>
On my bended knees<br>
Oh won't you give me<br>
Some of your loving, baby<br>
Please please please<br>
<br>
Though I keep trying hard<br>
To make her mine<br>
One day the wind will blow<br>
The sun will shine<br>
Till that time<br>
She puts my heart at ease<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
She locked my heart<br>
And threw away the keys<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the trees<br>
There's nothing shaking<br>
But the leaves on the tree</p>
