<br>
When I call you up <br>
Your line's engaged <br>
I have had enough <br>
So act your age <br>
We have lost the time <br>
that was so hard to find <br>
And I will lose my mind <br>
If you won't see me <br>
you won't see me <br>
<br>
I don't know why <br>
you should want to hide <br>
But I can't get through <br>
My hands are tied <br>
I won't want to stay <br>
I don't have much to say <br>
But I can't turn away <br>
And you won't see me <br>
you won't see me <br>
<br>
Time after time <br>
You refuse to even listen <br>
I wouldn't mind <br>
If I knew what I was missing <br>
Though the days are few <br>
They're filled with tears <br>
And since I lost you <br>
It feels like years <br>
Yes, it seems so long <br>
Girl, since you've been gone <br>
And I just can't go on <br>
If you won't see me <br>
you won't see me <br>
<br>
