<p><strong><font SIZE="6">She's Leaving Home</font></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<i>(Lennon/McCartney) Lead Vocal: McCartney</i><br>
<br>
<br>
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins <br>
Silently closing her bed room door <br>
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more <br>
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief <br>
Quietly turning the backdoor key <br>
Stepping outside she is free. <br>
<br>
She (We gave her most of our lives) <br>
is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives) <br>
home (We gave her everything money could buy) <br>
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye, bye) <br>
For so many years. <br>
<br>
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown <br>
Picks up the letter that's lying there <br>
Standing alone at the top of the stairs <br>
She breaks down and cries to her husband <br>
Daddy our baby's gone. <br>
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly <br>
How could she do this to me? <br>
<br>
She (We never thought of ourselves) <br>
is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves) <br>
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by) <br>
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye, bye) <br>
For so many years. <br>
<br>
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away <br>
Waiting to keep the appointment she made <br>
Meeting a man from the motor trade. <br>
<br>
She (What did we do that was wrong) <br>
is having (We didn't know it was wrong) <br>
fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy) <br>
Something inside that was always denied (Bye, bye) <br>
For so many years. <br>
She's leaving home (Bye, bye) </p>
