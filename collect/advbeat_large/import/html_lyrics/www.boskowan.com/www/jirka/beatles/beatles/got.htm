<br>
I was alone, I took a ride <br>
I didn't know what I would find there <br>
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there <br>
<br>
Ooh, then I suddenly see you <br>
Ooh, did I tell you I need you <br>
Every single day of my life <br>
<br>
You didn't run, you didn't lie <br>
You know I wanted just to hold you <br>
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again <br>
For I had told you <br>
<br>
Ooh, you were meant to be near me <br>
Ooh, and I want you hear me <br>
Say we'll be together every day <br>
<br>
Got to get you into my life <br>
<br>
What can I do, what can I be <br>
When I'm with you I want to stay there <br>
If I'm true I'll never leave <br>
And if I do I know the way there <br>
<br>
Ooh, then I suddenly see you <br>
Ooh, did I tell you I need you <br>
Every single day of my life <br>
<br>
Got to get you into my life <br>
Got to get you into my life <br>
<br>
I was alone, I took a ride, <br>
I didn't know what I would find there <br>
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there <br>
Then suddenly I see you <br>
Did I tell you I need you </p>
