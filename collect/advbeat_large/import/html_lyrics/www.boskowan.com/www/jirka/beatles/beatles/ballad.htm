<p><strong><font SIZE="6">The Ballad Of John And Yoko</font></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Standing in the dock at Southampton<br>
trying to get to Holland or France<br>
The man in the mac said<br>
you've got to go back<br>
You know they didn't even give us a chance<br>
<br>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br>
You know how hard it can be<br>
The way things are going<br>
They're going to crucify me<br>
<br>
Finally made the plane into Paris<br>
Honeymooning down by the Seine<br>
Peter Brown call to say<br>
you can make it O.K.<br>
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain<br>
<br>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br>
You know how hard it can be<br>
The way things are going<br>
They're going to crucify me<br>
<br>
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton<br>
Talking in our beds for a week<br>
The newspapers said<br>
say what're you doing in bed<br>
I said we're only trying to get us some peace<br>
<br>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br>
You know how hard it can be<br>
The way things are going<br>
They're going to crucify me<br>
<br>
Saving up your money for a rainy day<br>
giving all your clothes to charity<br>
Last night the wife said<br>
Oh boy when you're dead<br>
you don't take nothing with you but your soul, think<br>
<br>
Made a lightning trip to Vienna<br>
Eating chocolate cake in a bag<br>
The newspapers said<br>
she's gone to his head<br>
They look just like to Gurus in drag<br>
<br>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br>
You know how hard it can be<br>
The way things are going<br>
They're going to crucify me<br>
<br>
Caught the early plane back to London<br>
Fifty acorns tied in a sack<br>
The men from the press<br>
said we wish you successs<br>
It's good to have the both of you back<br>
<br>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br>
You know how hard it can be<br>
The way things are going<br>
They're going to crucify me<br>
The way things are going<br>
They're going to crucify me</p>
