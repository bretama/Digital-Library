You don't realize how much I need you, <br>
love you all the time and never leave you. <br>
Please come on back to me. <br>
I'm lonely as can be. I need you. <br>
<br>
Said you had a thing or two to tell me. <br>
How was I to know you would upset me? <br>
<br>
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes <br>
You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore. <br>
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore. <br>
<br>
Please remember how I feel about you, <br>
I could never really live without you, <br>
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you. <br>
