Cry baby cry <br>
Make your mother sigh <br>
She's old enough to know better. <br>
<br>
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen <br>
Cooking breakfast for the queen <br>
The queen was in the parlor <br>
Playing piano for the children of the king. <br>
<br>
Cry baby cry <br>
Make your mother sigh <br>
She's old enough to know better <br>
So cry baby cry. <br>
<br>
The king was in the garden <br>
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play <br>
The queen was in the playroom <br>
Painting pictures for the children's holiday. <br>
<br>
Cry baby cry <br>
Make your mother sigh <br>
She's old enough to know better <br>
So cry baby cry. <br>
<br>
The dutchess of Kircaldy always smiling <br>
And arriving late for tea <br>
The duke was having problems <br>
With a message at the local bird and bee. <br>
<br>
Cry baby cry <br>
Make your mother sigh <br>
She's old enough to know better <br>
So cry baby cry. <br>
<br>
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table <br>
For a seance in the dark <br>
With voices out of nowhere <br>
Put on specially by the children for a lark. <br>
<br>
Cry baby cry <br>
Make you mother sigh <br>
She's old enough to know better <br>
So cry baby cry, cry, cry, cry baby <br>
Make your mother sigh. <br>
<br>
She's old enough to know better <br>
Cry baby cry <br>
Cry, cry, cry <br>
Make your mother sigh <br>
She's old enough to know better <br>
So cry baby cry. <br>
<br>
[Can you take me back where I came from <br>
Can you take me back <br>
Can you take me back where I came from <br>
Brother can you take me back <br>
Can you take me back? <br>
<br>
Mm can you take me back where I came from <br>
Can you take me back?</p>
