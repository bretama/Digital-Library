<br>
This happened once before, <br>
When I came to you door, <br>
No reply. <br>
They said it wasn't you <br>
But I saw you peep through your window, <br>
<br>
I saw the life, I saw the lie, <br>
I know that you saw me, <br>
as I looked up to your face. <br>
<br>
I tried to telephone, <br>
They said you were not home, <br>
That's a lie, <br>
'cause I know where you've been, <br>
I saw you walk in your door, <br>
<br>
I nearly died, I nearly died, <br>
'cause you walked hand in hand <br>
With another man in my place. <br>
<br>
If I were you'd realize that I <br>
Love you more than any other guy, <br>
And I'll forgive the lies that I <br>
Heard before when you gave me no reply. <br>
