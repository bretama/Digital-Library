<br>
Is there anybody going to listen to my story <br>
All about the girl who came to stay? <br>
She's the kind of girl you want so much <br>
It makes you sorry <br>
Still, you don't regret a single day. <br>
Ah girl! Girl! <br>
<br>
When I think of all the times I've tried to leave her <br>
She will turn to me and start to cry; <br>
And she promises the earth to me <br>
And I believe her. <br>
After all this times I don't know why. <br>
Ah, girl! Girl! <br>
<br>
She's the kind of girl who puts you down <br>
When friends are there, you feel a fool. <br>
When you say she's looking good <br>
She acts as if it's understood. <br>
She's cool, oooh, oooh, oooh, <br>
Girl! Girl! <br>
<br>
Was she told when she was young that pain <br>
Would lead to pleasure? <br>
Did she understand it when they said <br>
That a man must break his back to earn <br>
His day of leisure? <br>
Will she still believe it when he's dead? <br>
Ah girl! Girl! Girl! <br>
<br>
Ah girl! Girl! Girl! </p>
