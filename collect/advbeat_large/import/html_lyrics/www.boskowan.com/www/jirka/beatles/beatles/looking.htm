I'm looking through you, where did you go? <br>
I though I knew you, what did I know? <br>
You don't look different, but you have changed <br>
I'm looking through you, you're not the same <br>
<br>
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear <br>
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear <br>
You don't sound different, I've learned the game. <br>
I'm looking through you, you're not the same <br>
<br>
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? <br>
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight <br>
<br>
You're thinking of me, the same old way <br>
You were above me, but not today <br>
The only difference is you're down there <br>
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere <br>
