For I have got another girl, another girl. <br>
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you, <br>
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new. <br>
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want, <br>
<br>
For I have got another girl, another girl. <br>
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few. <br>
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do. <br>
And so I'm telling you, &quot;This time you'd better stop.&quot; <br>
<br>
For I have got another girl. Another girl. <br>
Who will love me till the end. <br>
Through thick and thin <br>
She will always be my friend. <br>
<br>
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you, <br>
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new. <br>
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want, <br>
For I have got another girl. Another girl. <br>
Who will love me till the end. <br>
Through thick and thin <br>
She will always be my friend. <br>

For I have got another girl. Another girl. <br>
Another girl. </p>
