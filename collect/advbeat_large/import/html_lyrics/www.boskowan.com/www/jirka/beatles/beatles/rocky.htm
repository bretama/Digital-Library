<i>(Lennon/McCartney) Lead Vocal: McCartney</i><br>
<br>
<br>
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota <br>
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon <br>
And one day his woman ran off with another guy <br>
Hit young Rocky in the Rocky didn't like that <br>
He said I'm gonna get that boy <br>
So one day he walked into town <br>
Booked himself a room in the local saloon. <br>
<br>
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room <br>
Only to find Gideon's bible <br>
Rocky had come equipped with a gun <br>
To shoot off the legs of his rival <br>
His rival it seems had broken his dreams <br>
By stealing the girl of his fancy. <br>
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil <br>
But everyone knew her as Nancy. <br>
Now she and her man who called himself Dan <br>
Were in the next room at the hoe down <br>
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin <br>
He said Danny boy this is a showdown <br>
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot <br>
And Rocky collapsed in the corner. <br>
<br>
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin <br>
And proceeded to lie on the table <br>
He said Rocky you met your match <br>
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch <br>
And I'll be better...I'll be better doc as soon as I am able. <br>
<br>
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room <br>
Only to find Gideon's bible <br>
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt <br>
To help with good Rocky's revival. </p>
