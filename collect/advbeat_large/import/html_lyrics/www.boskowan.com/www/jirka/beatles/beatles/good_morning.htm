Good morning, good morning <br>
Good morning, good morning, good morning <br>
<br>
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in <br>
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been <br>
Nothing to do it's up to you <br>
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K. <br>
Good morning, good morning, good morning <br>
<br>
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down <br>
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town <br>
Everybody knows there's nothing doing <br>
Everything is closed it's like a ruin <br>
Everyone you see is half asleep. <br>
And you're on your own you're in the street <br>
<br>
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool. <br>
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school. <br>
Nothing has changed it's still the same <br>
I've got nothing to say but its O.K. <br>
Good morning, good morning, good morning <br>
<br>
People running round it's five o'clock. <br>
Everywhere in town is getting dark. <br>
Everyone you see is full of life. <br>
It's time for tea and meet the wife. <br>
<br>
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here. <br>
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear. <br>
Go to a show you hope she goes. <br>
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K. <br>
<br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good <br>
Good morning, good morning, good </p>
