  C
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
F
Listen for your footsteps but they don't arrive
G
Waiting for your knock dear on my old front door 
        F                                          C
I don't hear it does it mean you don't love me any more

  C
I hear the clock ticking on the matle shelf
F
See the hands a moving but I'm by myself
  G
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
        F                                           C 
I don't see you does it mean you don't love me anymore

                C           
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
                 F
'cause you know darling you know I love only you
              C                                        
you'll never know it hurt me so how I hate to see you go
              G
Don't pass me by
              F
Don't make me cry

      C
I'm sorry that I doubted you I was so unfair
F
you were in a car crash and you lost your hair
     G
you said that you would be late about an hour or two
   F                                                         C
I said that's alright I'm waiting here waiting to hear from you
